    <h1>Blood Pressure and Measurement</h1>
    <p>Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood against the walls of the blood vessels, measured in
        millimeters
        of mercury (mmHg). It's represented by two numbers: the systolic pressure (when the heart beats) and the
        diastolic pressure (when the heart rests between beats).</p>

    <h2>Why is Blood Pressure Measurement Important?</h2>
    <p>Optimal blood pressure is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular health. High blood pressure (hypertension)
        increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, while low blood pressure (hypotension) can lead to dizziness
        and
        fainting.</p>

    <h2>How to Measure Blood Pressure?</h2>
    <p>Blood pressure is typically measured using a sphygmomanometer, which consists of an inflatable cuff and a
        pressure gauge. The cuff is wrapped around the upper arm, and air is pumped into it and then slowly released
        while monitoring the gauge.</p>

    <h2>Steps for Blood Pressure Measurement:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rest for at least 5 minutes in a seated or lying position.</li>
        <li>Find a quiet environment.</li>
        <li>Place the cuff on your upper arm (at heart level).</li>
        <li>Start the blood pressure monitor.</li>
        <li>Record the results, including systolic and diastolic values.</li>
        <li>Consult a healthcare professional if you consistently measure high or low readings, or if you're
            concerned
            about your results.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Regular blood pressure monitoring is essential for maintaining good health and preventing cardiovascular
        complications. Be sure to follow these steps carefully and seek medical advice if needed.</p>
